
Retail Store Database Management System
Project Description
A retail store chain operates multiple branches across different cities. The company requires an efficient database system to manage store operations, employees, customers, suppliers, and sales transactions.

The database should:
✅ Maintain a record of all stores and their locations.
✅ Store details of employees, their roles, salaries, and assigned stores.
✅ Track customers, their contact details, and purchase history.
✅ Record sales transactions, linking employees to customers.
✅ Manage suppliers, tracking the type of products they provide to specific stores.
